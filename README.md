# Reviewing this application

Hey! Thanks for checking out our calendar. You can perform the following actions:

1. Create an event
2. Edit an event
3. Delete an event
4. Add a reminder for the event in all major calendars
5. Change to dark mode
6. Drag and drop events to change their dates
7. Navigate the calendar
8. Save the data to your local device (desktop and PC)

This app can be viewed on both mobile and PC. As this was a test there are varying experiences on different operating systems and browsers. **This is best viewed on Google Chrome.**

Thanks!
MLC Team.
